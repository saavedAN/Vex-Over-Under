## Description
This program is the only program that 4303X is using this year. 
There are a few disadvantages to this, but they are quickly out-weighed by the advantages.
The autonomous selector is one of the many things that will make this file format much easier than having multiple different repositories.

### Autons
There are currently only two autons planned for this year.
One starts on the alliance's offensive zone, and the other starts in the opposing zone.
The opposing zone's auton is planned to score 3-4 triballs, including the preload.
The alliance zone's auton is planned to score 2-3 triballs, and end touching the elevation bar (for AWP).

### User Control
The user control is very basic. 
Tank drive, PTO, intake, and a linear puncher.

### Ports
#### Negative sign means the port is reversed
Left PTO = 9,
Left Back = -15,
Left Front = -17,
Right PTO = -10,

Right Front = 2,
